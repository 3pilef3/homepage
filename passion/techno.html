    <h1 class="uno"> techno </h1>
    <p>
        one of my passions is music. specifically, dance music.
        <br>
        dance music encompases many different genres and styles of music. within dance music, i am an avid enjoyer of techno.
        <br>
        as most music genres are, techno music is a broad term with many different subgenres.
        <br>
        in reality, i appreciate most varieties that techno comes in, although my favorite styles include hypnotic and minimal techno, as well as tribal and hardgroove techno. 
        the intersection between dark and tribal sounding techno is something i am interested in, and explore this sound with my own music production.
        <br>
        <br>
        here is a list of some techno i have been listening to. 
        <ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HerKDjGfeGg">richard turner - serial scratch</a>
            <li><a href="https://moleculartechno.bandcamp.com/album/p-ben-climatic"> p-ben - climactic</a>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEVX8KalYO8&t=103s">radiumz - space tribal mix </a>
        </li></ul>

    the idea of raves and dance parties are one of a kind to me. a place where people can lose themselves on the dancefloor
    and forget their troubles for a couple hours is something that is special and cannot be replicated often. 
    i find this intersection of environment and sound very interesting, and for me, goes far beyond techno, djing, and dancing.
