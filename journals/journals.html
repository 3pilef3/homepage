ursula k le guin - a rant on technology
<br> 
<p> i liked the ursula le guin reading - it reminded me of an essay i have read
    before,  <i>i, pencil,</i> by leonard read. in this essay leonard read talks about
    technology, and states that even the simplest of technology requires hard human and machine
    work to produce. le guin talks about technology in a similar way. she expands on 
    soft and hard science fiction and how technology - whether machines and engineering 
    or how a population sources food and water - are both important things to establish.

j.r. carpenter - a handmade web
<br>
<p> there is a couple of quotes that stuck out to me in j.r. carpenter's essay. the comparisons 
    are really interesting... "evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to draw attention to the physical body"
    stands out to me. as we create and learn how to code a website by hand it reminds me of the physical labor 
    it takes to do much of things in life. like the care a chef puts into a meal or 
    a skiier descending a slope, we work and build a relationship with our codes and computers
    through process of trial and error.

taeyoon choi - hello world
<br> 
<p> i enjoyed the illustrations and images in this reading. taeyoon choi's paintings stuck out to me 
    as well. the paintings of tablets and computers made me think about art and tools - is the computer we use
    to build a website art itself or soley a medium to make art? same with a pen or paintbrush. how do these tools 
    we use to create other things shape the way final products come out? 
    even as we navigate computer interfaces and have keyboards that let us 
    type, spell, and play, there is so much going on inside the systenm that we are unaware of.

callum copley - a friend is writing
<br>
<p>this website was such a fun (and stressful) way to navigate a reading. i kept getting distracted 
    by the pop ups and noises that the site would make.
